<body bgcolor="#B2D1B2">

<p style = "color:blue;"> "Gohan, get out of here", said the saiyan named Goku. Frieza triumphantly looks at Goku, 
"you think that I would let<br> your son just leave? I'm the strongest in the universe!"</p>

<p style = "color: blue;"> "Dont you dare talk about my son like that", Goku said. "And what will you do about it, hmmm?", replied<br>
Frieza. "I'm gonna take you down, that's what", Goku shot angrily.</p>

<p style = "color:blue;"> Goku begins to blast Frieza with a ki blast. One of Frieza's minions survives 
and begins to sneak up <br>behind Goku as they fight. "I will prevail!", says Frieza. His minion gets into position and attacks
Goku.</p>

<p style = "color:blue;"> Goku catches the minion's attack, and throws the minion aside as Frieza hits Goku in the face with a powerful punch. <br>
"What?!", Frieza exclaimed as the attack did not hurt Goku. Goku proceeds to grab Frieza's fist and brings the <br>
fist besides him.</p>

<p style = "color:blue;"> "Let go of me!", Frieza shouted while trying to pull his fist out from Goku's grasp. It wouldn't budge.<br>
"Impossible!", Frieza exclaimed while continuing to pull. Finally, Goku let go of Frieza's fist, and fires a large blast<br>
at Frieza, blowing Frieza to the ground.</p>
